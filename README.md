# DB-Email-Counter

The original code for this program was provided 
by University of Michigan's online course
"Using Databases with Python" on Coursera.

The code is then modified to let the user
scan incoming email logs contained within mbox.txt
and count the occurrences of each domain name,
which is then stored in an SQLite3 database.
